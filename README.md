# AI2M (AI to Money) 🚀

## Overview
AI2M is an open-source project aimed at building a framework for converting AI knowledge into commercial value. The project's core objectives include:
- Establishing standardized management of AI technical knowledge
- Providing reusable AI engineering solutions
- Exploring AI commercialization pathways
- Building an intellectual property protection system

This repository uses Git version control to achieve:
- Version-controlled technical documentation
- Modular code asset organization
- Systematic patent strategy management
- Lifecycle management of temporary files
